//To compare two strings.
***Questions to be asked***
1.Are strings equal?
2.Are the strings case sensitive?
3.What if one of the string is empty?
4.Any of the strings are NULL?

***Algorithm***
1.Input two strings and compare them character by character.
2.Before doing that, we can findout the length of the strings.
3.If the lengths are not equal, we don't have to compare at all. which reduces time complexity.
4.After comparision if strings are equal, then print they are equal

***CODE***

#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
    char string1[] = "hello world";
    char string2[] = "hello world 2";
    
    int i=0;
    int n= strlen(string1);
    int m= strlen(string2);
    if(m == n)
    {
      while(i<n)
        {
            if(string1[i] == string2[i])
             i++;
        }
       
         printf("Strings are equal");
    }  
    else
    {
        printf("Both the strings are different");
    }
    return 0;
}

***TEst cases***
1.What if either of the strings are NULL
2.What if either of the strings are empty
3.What if the string length is not finite
